He most recently worked an Airline Pilot and is now an endeavoring programmer/developer. He is currently attending the Univeristy of Minnesota's Coding Bootcamp focused on Full-Stack development including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node/NPM, VS Code, Git, mySQL, Firebase, and Heroku.  His expected completion date is June 2022.
              </p>
              <p> His programming journey started in high-school where he taught himself Basic while experimenting in his study-hall which just happened to be the school's computer lab. He continued his learning as he entered the military/workforce.  He soon evolved into learning Visual Basic and using Microsoft VBA for both Access and Excel - which also led to his mastering of Structured Query Language (SQL); along with the manipulation of the SQL through VBA.  Over the years, he has written several applications which he has incoproated into his jobs and used by his employers and emplohyees; including for professional military training tracking, sales management, flight school training record keeping, drug testing customer and collection database, and several data parsing programs for integration of enterprise systems.
